- Type: Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has
---
Types: 1. Primitive Types and 2. Object Types


Primitive- number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null


Object- functions, classes, arrays, objects

Why do we care about Types-
1. Types are used by the TS Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
2. Types allow other Engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebases. 

Where do we use types- EVERYWHERE!


**Type Annotations and Type Inference on Variables**

Annotations: Code we add to tell TS what type of value a varible will refer to.(Devs tell TS the type)

Inference: TS tries to figure out what types of value a variable refers to. (TS guesses the type)
